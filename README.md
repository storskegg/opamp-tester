# opamp-tester

A simple tester for OpAmps. This is a gratuitous copy of the schematic shown in
IMSAIGuy's videos; see link below.

The reason why I did this build is that I wanted to add support for testing single
opamps in addition to dual and quad. Additionally, I chose to space things out a bit
so that I can solder ZIF sockets.

For the life of me I could not find ZIF sockets under 14 pins, so...ja, all three
sockets are 14-pin.
